# Kubatorn_formula
KUB formula, C++

The program calculates the integral over the triangle using the cubic formula, then calculates the integral over the triangle by changing to baricentric coordinates (calculates the exact value of the integral). We construct hypotheses about the algebraic order of the formula, and then we confirm it by dividing the triangle by the middle lines into similar ones, and performing calculations according to the formula for them. The deld relationship is constant, so the algebraic order has been found.
